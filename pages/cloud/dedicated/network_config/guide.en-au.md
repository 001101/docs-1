## Network Bridging
Network bridging is the action taken by network equipment to create an aggregate network from either two or more communication networks, or two or more network segments. Bridging is distinct from routing which allows the networks to communicate independently as separate networks .

The Network Bridge configuration is most commonly used in the context of virtualization to allow each Virtual Machine to have their own public IP address.

## IP Aliasing
IP aliasing is associating more than one IP address to a network interface. With this, one node on a network can have multiple connections to a network, each serving a different purpose .
