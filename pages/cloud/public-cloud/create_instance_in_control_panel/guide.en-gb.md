## 
The Public Cloud lets you create virtual servers (instances) quickly and easily in just a few clicks. 
These instances are similar to [OVH VPS](http://www.ovh.co.uk/vps/) but not exactly the same. 
Here are the main differences between VPS and Public Cloud instances:

VPS:

- Simple customer interface
- Focused on a single machine
- A large number of distributions provided


Public Cloud Instance:

- Choose to pay monthly or by the hour
- OpenStack API
- Instances working together


This guide will explain how to create an instance.
