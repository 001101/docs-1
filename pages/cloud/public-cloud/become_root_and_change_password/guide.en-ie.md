- Installing packages
- Selecting a password for a user or root user (This is necessary for KVM access)
- Carrying out certain administrative tasks




## Prerequisites

- []({legacy}1775)
- You must be logged in as the default user (admin or the distribution name for the most recent images)



## Information
We are assuming in this guide that the default user is called admin.


## Enter a password

- Enter a password for the admin user (For security reasons, the password will not be shown as you type it):

```
~$ sudo passwd
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated
