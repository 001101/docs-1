## 
If you need to configure a failover IP address on your instances because:

- You have many websites on your instance, 
- You host international projects,
- You want to migrate from a dedicated server to a Public cloud instance, 

You can import a failover IP address which is linked to a different OVH service.

This guide explains how to import this failover IP into your OVH Public Cloud project.


## Prerequisites

- You must have a failover IP linked to a dedicated server.

Example: An IP in the Dedicated section of the Control Panel:

## To a dedicated server
