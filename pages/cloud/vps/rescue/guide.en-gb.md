## Objective

Rescue mode is a tool on your VPS. You can use it to boot your VPS into a temporary Operating System, in order to diagnose and resolve issues on your primary OS.

These issues could include:

  - Resetting your root password
  - Diagnosing network problems
  - Repairing broken Operating System
  - Fixing a software firewall misconfiguration
  - Testing disk performance

  Performing checks in Rescue Mode helps you determine if an issue is software or hardware related.

> [!warning]
>
> If you have any services online, rescue mode will interrupt them as the machine is being rebooted into the OVH rescue environment.
>

This guide will show you how to reboot your VPS in rescue mode.
