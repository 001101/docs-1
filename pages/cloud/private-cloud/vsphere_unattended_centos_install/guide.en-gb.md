**Last updated 19th September 2018**

## Objective

This first guide will go throught:

1. create a [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) 7 ISO with a kickstart config file
2. create a virtual image template inside vSphere on OVH [Private Cloud Computing](https://www.ovh.com/private-cloud/)

## Requirements

- an access to a vSphere instance
- a terminal with root access for package installation. It can be a Debian under [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux), CentOS, Ubuntu, ...

> The resources used to automate this guide are available here: [https://github.com/ovh/docs/tree/master/pages/cloud/private-cloud/vsphere_unattended_centos_install/scripts/](https://github.com/ovh/docs/tree/master/pages/cloud/private-cloud/vsphere_unattended_centos_install/scripts/).
> 

From your terminal, install `ansible` and `govc`.

If you use `python-2`, make sure to use `ansible-2.7` or above due to issue [#42237](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42237) otherwise, switch to `python-3` and `ansible-2.6.4`

All variables are set in a `vars.yml` file that needs to be edited before running the playbooks

### GOVC installation

`govc` is a Go client using the vSphere API. You can fetch the latest release from the [Release](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/releases) page.

After an `unzip` or `tar` and `chmod +x`, you'll need to setup at least three environmnent variables.

```shell
export GOVC_URL=https://pcc-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ovh.com/sdk
export GOVC_USERNAME=username
export GOVC_PASSWORD=password
```

> [!primary]
> 
> **Tip**: Edit a file `activate` with the three export commands and source it `. activate` from your terminal before running the scripts.
> 

You can now try the following command

```shell
$ govc about
Name:         VMware vCenter Server
Vendor:       VMware, Inc.
Version:      6.0.0
Build:        7037394
OS type:      win32-x64
API type:     VirtualCenter
API version:  6.0
Product ID:   vpx
UUID:         xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Preparing ISO images

There will be two images.

The first one will be the unmodified Centos iso file.
There are three ISO flavors. We'll pick the DVD edition, the smallest one with the `open-vm-tools` package.

The second one will a simple iso volume named `OEMDRV` containing the `/KS.CFG` file. The full documentation is on [RedHat documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-kickstart-howto#sect-kickstart-installation-starting) page.

The above steps can be automated via

```shell
sudo ansible-playbook -vvv --extra-vars @vars.yml create_isos.yml
```

You are now ready to move the the second section.

## Creating a vSphere VM template.

We'll first upload the two ISO images created in the previous step in a datastore define by the variable `datastore`.

Then, we'll create the virtual machine and attach two CDROM devices, each for one of the ISO files.

During the installation, to observe what is happening you can connect using the [VMware Remote Console](https://www.vmware.com/go/download-vmrc) and get the vmrc link with `govc vm.console Centos7`

> [!primary]
> 
> **Tip**: Without VMRC, you can check if the install is done by trying to connect the the VM guest tool daemon with `govc guest.ls -l root:test -vm centos7 .`
>
> Be sure the use the proper password defined is the `ks.cfg` file
> 

Once the installation is done and the VM has rebooted, we'll eject the ISO files and convert the VM to a template.

The above can be done automated via

```shell
ansible-playbook -vvv --extra-vars @vars.yml create_template.yml
```

## Conclusion

We have learn how to create a custion unattended installation CentOS ISO file and a VM template in vSphere.

## Go further

The next step is to deploy our first [OpenShift Origin mono-server instance](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/private-cloud/openshift-private-cloud-mono-server/).
