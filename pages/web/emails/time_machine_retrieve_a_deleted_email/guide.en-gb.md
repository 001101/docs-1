## Access backups

## Retrieving a deleted email

- Next choose the day for the backup that you want, in order to access the email you need. In this case we are trying to retrieve the OVH email mail test from Friday at 13:17 in the "INBOX" folder for the D-3 backup.

- You then just have to drag and drop the email in to the folder that you want in your current inbox.

## Confirmation

- Once the email has been moved, we can see that a copy of the email is placed in the desired folder.
