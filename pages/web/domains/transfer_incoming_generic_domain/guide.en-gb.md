## Objective

By transferring your domain name, you will change your domain name registrar. You can transfer a domain name to OVH. The process will take 1-10 days.

**Find out how to transfer a generic domain name to OVH.**

## Requirements

- You must have a generic domain name (with an extension such as: .com, .net, .info, etc.) registered with another domain name registrar.
- You must have the authority to request a transfer for the domain name. The domain name holder and/or its administrators must be informed of the transfer request.
- The domain name must be more than 61 days old.
- The domain name must not have been transferred or changed holders within the last 61 days.
- The domain name must be unlocked.
- You must have a transfer code, or be able to receive one.
- The email addresses for the contacts listed in the *WHOIS* database must be valid.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check the information related to the domain

Your domain name is currently filed with a registrar. Would you like to change this, and make OVH your new domain name registrar?

If so, you can do this by following a transfer procedure. This will require the involvement of several organisations: OVH, your current domain name registrar, and other parties. Over the course of this procedure, several validations will be required. **For this reason, it is important to ensure that the information related to the domain name is up-to-date.**

You can do this using our *WHOIS* tool, which you can access via this link: [https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/whois.pl](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/whois.pl){.external}. The result given will display several pieces of information.

- **If the information is correct**: contact your domain name registrar to unlock your domain.

- **If the information is incorrect, or not visible**: contact your domain name registrar to check and/or modify it.

> If you do not know which registrar your domain is filed with, the "Registrar" lines, which will appear as part of the [*Whois* tool](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/whois.pl){.external} search result, can provide you with information on its identity.

This table summarises the steps of a transfer procedure.

|Steps|Description|Who is involved?|Where?|Time periods| 
|---|---|---|---|---| 
|1|Unlock your domain|The domain name admin, with agreement from the domain name holder|With the current registrar|According to your action| 
|2|Receive the transfer code|The domain name admin, with agreement from the domain name holder|With the current registrar|According to your action| 
|3|Request the domain name transfer|Whoever has the transfer code, still with agreement from the domain name holder|With the new registrar (e.g. OVH)|According to your action| 
|4|First stage of transfer validation|The domain name holder, as well as the admin in contact with the new registrar|Via an email received|Five days maximum| 
|5|Second stage of transfer validation|With the current registrar|Via a request from the organisation managing your domain name extension|5 days maximum|

### Step 2: Unlock the domain name

Once you have checked this information, you will need to unlock your domain name. You can only do this via your current domain name registrar. Please contact them to find out more about their procedure.

Once you have unlocked your domain name, your domain name registrar must send you the transfer code for it. This code is sometimes referred to using different names, such as: **transfer code**, **AuthCode**, **AuthInfo** or **EPP code**.

Please note that OVH is not your current domain name registrar. We are, therefore, unable to unlock your domain or provide the transfer code.

> [!warning]
>
> Once you have unlocked your domain name, you will have 7 days to begin transferring it to OVH. After this 7-day period, your domain will be locked automatically if you do not submit a request to change your domain name registrar.
>

### Step 3: Order the transfer to OVH

Now that your domain name is unlocked and you have your transfer code, you can request for your domain name to be transferred to OVH. To do this, you will need to order a domain name transfer on [our website](https://www.ovh.co.uk/){.external}.

Enter your domain name, and follow the order process. When you are asked to provide your transfer code, enter it in the box next to your domain name. If you do not have the transfer code, you can tick a box labelled `Enter transfer code at a later stage`{.action}. Before you proceed with this process, please make every effort to ensure that you are able to receive this transfer code. 

In this order process, you can add a [web hosting plan](https://www.ovh.co.uk/web-hosting/){.external}, other OVH solutions, or DNS servers to your order. These steps may be of interest to you, if you are also looking to migrate your services (website and emails) to OVH.

> [!warning]
>
> We advise that you take care choosing your DNS servers when you order. If your domain name is used for a website or emails, you must ensure that you enter the DNS servers currently being used by your domain name.
>

Once you receive the purchase order, pay the amount requested for the domain name transfer process to begin. The transfer process will start when we receive your payment. Depending on which generic domain name extension you are using, you may be able to track the domain name transfer procedure in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

### Step 4: Confirm the transfer

Now that the transfer process has been initiated, two validation procedures are required before the transfer process is complete.

#### First step of validation

This validation step will begin as soon as the transfer process starts, and can take a maximum of 5 days. Two validation requests are sent for this first step.

|Who receives a validation request?|Where is the validation request sent to?| 
|---|---| 
|The domain name holder|To the domain name holder’s email address, listed in the *WHOIS* database| 
|The designated admin, during the order process with OVH|To the admin profile’s email address at OVH|

Several outcomes are possible, depending on the responses received.

|Possible outcomes|Sequence of events| 
|---|---| 
|Domain name holder and admin validation|Progress to the second validation step within 24 hours maximum| 
|Only 1 validation (from either contact), and 1 request without a response|Progress to the second validation step, after a 5-day time period| 
|No response to both validation requests|The transfer process is cancelled after a 5-day time period| 
|A refusal (from either contact)|The transfer process is cancelled as soon as a refusal notification is received from either of the contacts|

The two parties provide their validation through an OVH interface. The emails sent to the two parties will contain a link to this interface, where they can confirm or modify the information displayed.

If a transfer is cancelled, please ensure that the various parties are in agreement with this, and that their email addresses are up-to-date. The transfer process can be restarted at a later stage from the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} in the `Domains`{.action} section, then `Ongoing operations`{.action}.

#### Second step of validation

Once the second step has been initiated, the current domain name registrar (which is still not OVH) will receive a validation request. Several outcomes are possible, depending on the responses received.

|Possible outcomes|Sequence of events| 
|---|---| 
|Validation from the current registrar|Transfer is complete in 24 hours maximum| 
|No response from the current registrar|Transfer is complete after a 5-day time period| 
|Refusal from the current registrar|The transfer is cancelled as soon as a refusal notification is received|

If a refusal notification is sent by the current registrar, please contact them to find out the reasons why they refused it. The transfer process can be restarted from the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} in the `Domains`{.action} section, then `Ongoing operations`{.action}.

### Step 5: Manage your domain

Once the transfer process is complete, your domain can be managed from your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

Please note that for any paid generic domain name transfer, we will credit an extra year for it on the expiry date.
