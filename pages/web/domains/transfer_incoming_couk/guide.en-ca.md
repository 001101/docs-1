## Step 1: Change your domain TAG
To transfer your domain to OVH, you do not need to create an order, because the transfer is free and is managed by a TAG system.
First you have to inform your current registrar of the OVH TAG.
The OVH TAG is "OVH-FR"
The list of TAGS[/ blue] for different registrars is available on Nominet's [official website](http://www.nominet.uk/registrar-list).
If you do not manage to change your domain name TAG with your current registrar you can ask Nominet to change it for you. 

Please go to the Registrar's website:
[Manage your domain - Change registrar](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/manage-your-domain/change-registrar).
Please note, Nominet will charge for this service.


## Step 2: Transfer domain to OVH
Once you have changed the TAG, the domain will automatically be transferred to OVH in a few hours.


## Step 3: Contact confirmation
Following the transfer, the domain name owner will receive an email to the contact address that is stated in the whois.
You will be asked to specify your chosen contacts for this domain name, in normal or expert mode:

Normal mode:

- Enter the Nichandle which will be the Administration, Technical and Billing contact for this domain. 
- Check the boxes to confirm the transfer, then click "save".

## Step 4: Completion
Your domain will be available in your customer account in a few hoursâ€™ time.


## Cost of .co.uk domain name transfer or similar
Transfer is free.


## Time it takes to transfer a .co.uk domain name or similar
If you verify the email sent to the owner, the transfer will take under 24h.


## Renewing a domain after a transfer
As the transfer is free, the expiration date following the transfer will be the same as it was before the transfer.
To renew it following the transfer, go to [ovh.co.uk](https://www.ovh.co.uk/).
