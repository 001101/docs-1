## Step 2: Setup via the Web Control Panel
A new window will open. Please enter the following information:

"Email address": the email address that will send messages to the mailing list. Please note: you cannot enter an existing email address.

"Name of group": the display name that appears in your [Web Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login.html) and in [OVH webmail](https://ex.mail.ovh.net/owa/).

"Max size incoming": you can specify the size of attachments for incoming and outgoing emails.

"Manage subscribers": specifies the security level of access to the group.

The same applies for "Manage un-subscribers"

"Hide in Outlook": if this box is ticked, the group address will not appear in the Exchange service list of addresses.

"Authentication required": if this box is ticked, only group members will be able to send a message using the group address.
