**What is Outlook Web App (OWA)?**

OWA is the Exchange webmail. This interface lets you access and use your Exchange account and the various associated features from a classic web page.

This interface is very useful if you do not have the email software to configure and use an Exchange account.

**Where and how do I log in to OWA?**

The email address will be the full Exchange address that you wish to view.

The password matches the one you entered when you created the Exchange address in your [ Web Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login.html).

Hosted Exchange:

- [https://ex.mail.ovh.net](https://ex.mail.ovh.net)
- [https://ex2.mail.ovh.net](https://ex2.mail.ovh.net)
- [https://ex3.mail.ovh.net](https://ex3.mail.ovh.net)

Private Exchange: The access URL will depend on the hostname of your server, defined when setting up the service.
