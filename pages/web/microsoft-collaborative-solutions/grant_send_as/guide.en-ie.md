## Setting up Send As rights: Part 1
This action must be carried out via the [Web Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/login.html).

Once you have logged in, select your Exchange service by clicking on it in the left-hand column under "Platforms".

Click on the "Email accounts" tab, then click the "More actions" icon on the far right (three blue dots).

Then select "Manage delegations".

## Outlook Web App set up: Part 1
You can check via [OWA](https://ex.mail.ovh.net/owa) that you can now send an email as another account. (E.g. "test@design-tk.fr" as "config@design-tk.fr").

Click on "+ new mail" and then click the "..." icon to the right "Insert" in order to make the "From" field appear. 

Click on "From" and right-click the existing address to remove it. You can then enter the second address manually.
It will thus be saved automatically.
