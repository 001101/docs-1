## Requirements

- You must have a [web](https://www.ovh.co.uk/web-hosting/) hosting plan that allows an SSH connection (**from the Pro plan onwards**)
- Logging in to your Web Hosting plan via SSH (see our guide on [Using SSH access to your Web Hosting plan](../web_hosting_ssh_on_web_hosting_packages/))

## Instructions

### Creation of the repository

Once you have logged in via [SSH on your hosting](../web_hosting_ssh_on_web_hosting_packages/){.external} plan, create the root directory of your SVN repositories, then create the repository.

To do this, simply type the command:

```bash
mkdir svn
```

and

```bash
svnadmin create svn/depot_test
```

You can then check that the directories have been created with the following command:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should get the directories as shown in the following image:

### Create public/private keys

Before you continue, you will need to create a pair of SSH keys from the desktop you will use to connect to the SVN repository.

Please follow our guide on [Creating SSH](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/create-ssh-keys/) keys. You do not need to follow the [Import your SSH key step in the OVHcloud Control Panel](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/create-ssh-keys/#importing-your-ssh-key-into-the-ovhcloud-control-panel_1) in this guide.

### Added public key to the hosting plan

Once you have obtained your key, add it to your web hosting plan in the .ssh/authorised_keys2 file. To do this, type the command line below:

```bash
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
vi .ssh/authorized_keys2
```

Once the file is open, insert the following line:

```bash
command="/usr/bin/svnserve --root=/homez.XXX/loginFTP/svn --tunnel --tunnel-user=john",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty
```

Followed by the previously created key, all on the same line.

> To find out the numbers to use to replace "/home.XXX/loginFTP", type the command "pwd" in SSH.

You can retrieve the contents of the repository without logging in directly via SSH on the machine.

### Examples

#### On Linux

You can test from the computer connecting to the SVN repository by typing the following line:

```bash
svn checkout svn+ssh://loginFTP@clusterXXX/depot_test
```

#### Windows avec TortoiseSVN

- Download and install TortoiseSVN ([http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads){.external})
- Right-click on the private key. An icon appears in the bottom right-hand corner, and the key is loaded into the authentication agent.
- Create a directory, right-click on it and select "SVN Checkout". 
- Enter `svn+ssh://loginFTP@xxplan.ovh.net/depot_test` in the “URL of repository” field and click `OK`:

There is very good English documentation for Subversion: [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/index.html](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/index.html){.external}

### Specific cases

#### Create multiple accounts

First, you need to have created several SSH keys. Then when adding the public key to the hosting:

```bash
command="/usr/bin/svnserve --root=/home.XXX/loginFTP/svn --tunnel --tunnel-user=marc",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty
```

You must change the setting below by adding your different users:

```bash
--tunnel-user
```

note that it is also possible to give access in drive only by adding the parameter:

```bash
--read-only.
```

#### Check locally from the server

When you want to do a local check, the examples provided will not work. You will need to use:

```bash
svn+ssh://login@ftp.nom-du-site.tld/home.XXX/login/svn/depot_test
```
