## Objective

OVHcloud provides tools integrated into the OVHcloud Control Panel, for sending SMS messages. This guide will help you get familiar with these tools, and use them to send your first SMS campaign.

## Requirements

- an OVHcloud SMS account with SMS credits

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager), then select `Telecom`{.action} (1). Next, click `SMS`{.action} on the left (2), and select your SMS account (3).

The toolbar (4) will give you access to the main features for sending SMS campaigns.

### Step 1: Send SMS messages.

With the `SMS`{.action} tab, you can access the sending options , the log of SMS messages sent and received, and scheduled SMS messages that are due to be sent in future.

To send an SMS message via the OVHcloud Control Panel, you can refer to [this guide](../send_sms_messages_via_control_panel).

You can also refer to our guide on [Managing SMS logs](../manage_sms_logs/).

### Step 2: Add a recipient list.

Via the `Contacts`{.action}, tab, you can send your SMS message to one or more recipient lists. These lists can be exported as .csv or .txt files.

With the following guide, you can find out how to [create a list of SMS recipients](../create_sms_recipient_list/).

### Step 3: Add an address book.

Via the `Address book`{.action} tab, you can create several address books you can send SMS messages to. Unlike a recipient list, address books contain contacts you can name, and more easily identify in targeted campaigns.

Refer to our guide on [Managing SMS address books](../manage-sms-address-books/) to find out more.

### Step 4: Create a sender.

By default, SMS messages from an OVHcloud account in France are sent from a short number, which enables recipients to reply back. You may want to create an alpha-numeric sender name via the `Senders`{.action} tab, so that your SMS messages are sent with your company or organisationâ€™s name.
