xcerpt: You can now renew your services automatically. First you need to choose a payment method and then choose the services that you wish to automatically renew.
section: Payment preferences

## Overview
You can add and choose your payment method in the [Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/) under "Billing", "My payment methods" and "Add a method of payment".

Please note: if no payment method is enabled and you select one of your services for automatic renewal, your OVH account will  be debited and you will need to settle it to avoid any service interruptions.

You can enable direct debit under 
"My services".

To authorise your credit or debit card, an initial charge of Â£1 excl.VAT will be taken from your bank account.
This amount will be immediately credited to your OVH account and deducted from your next invoice.
You credit or debit card will be activated immediately.

## Type of renewal enabled on your service.
Firstly go to "My services" to select the services to be automatically renewed.

![](images/3740.png){.thumbnail}
You will find the following elements in the table:


- Automatic renewal date: Here you have to choose the day of the month when you want OVH to carry out the withdrawal using your payment method. 

- Login: This column corresponds to the name of the service concerned. 

- Renewal: This column lets you verify the current renewal type on your service.

- 1. All services: here you can filter the table by service type.

- 2. Date:  You can filter the table so that only the services which    "expire in a week", "expire in a month" or have already "expired" are displayed.

- 3. Renewal: Here you can filter the table to show only the services which are in "annual automatic renewal", "monthly automatic renewal" or "manual renewal" mode.

Clicking "Cancel" disables automatic renewal and your service will be deleted on the expiration date.


## Choice of automatic renewal
If you click on the "pen" to the right of the service in the "renewal" column you can modify the renewal type. 


- Renewal: Here you can choose "Automatic" to specify that you want automatic renewal. 

- Frequency: Depending on the type of service chosen, you can choose how often you pay. 

If you choose "two months" as the frequency, an amount equivalent to two months of service usage will be charged every two months.

## Operation
On the February 2nd 2014, I set up an automatic renewal on February 12th. The renewal period is 1 year for each service.

![](images/1564.png){.thumbnail}
Caution: the consolidated renewal won't take place on February 2nd; it will take place on the date that you have selected: February 12th 2014!!

When you activate automatic renewal for your services, the initial consolidated renewal will take place after one month. You may then have to modify the length of your renewals, hence why the initial renewal is monthly.
It's only possible to renew OVH's own services (such as hosting, Private SQL, options, etc).

/!\ Domain names can be renewed only for one year minimum; consolidated renewal doesn't cover these. This explains the importance of selecting a general renewal date.

What you need to know:
To renew the services on your selected date, we'll go by this date every month to check which services are due to expire between this date (included) and the same date in the following month. This happens regardless of the renewal period that you've selected.

In my case, on February 12th 2014, a purchase order would look like this:


- Service 3: for 1 month + 1 day (from February 11th to March 12th 2014);
- Service 5: for 27 days (from  February 13th to  March 12th 2014);

thus aligning the expirations dates of both services to March 12th 2014.

On March 12th 2014, Services 3 & 5 will therefore be renewed for 1 year (selected period).

Caution: Service 3 that expires on February 11th 2014 will be deactivated until February 12th 2014!

Service 2 expires on February 12th 2014. Therefore, it'll be automatically renewed for 1 year  (selected duration).

Regarding Service 4 that expires on February 15th 2014, we'll detect that it expires between  February 12th 2014 and March 12th 2014. It'll be renewed for 1 year and the 1 year will be credited on the date of termination of the service.

So, on February 12th 2014, my Service 4 will be renewed for 1 additional year, and its new expiration date will be February 15th 2015.

Service 1 will be unavailable from February 10th to 12th 2014 but will be automatically renewed for 1 year (selected duration) on February 12th 2014.

 To summarise, the correct February 12th order includes:
Consolidations:

- Service 3: to 1 month + 1 day[ blue] (from February 11 to March 12th 2014)
- Service 5: to 27 days (from February 13 to March 12th 2014)

Renewals:

- Service 1: to 1 year (from February 10th 2014 to February 10th 2015)
- Service 2: to 1 year (from February 12th 2014 to February 12th 2015)
- Service 4: to 1 year (from February 15th 2014 to February 15th 2015)

The correct March 12th 2014 order includes:


Renewals:

- Service 3: to 1 year (from March 12th 2014 to March 12th 2015)
- Service 5: to 1 year (from March 12th 2014 to March 12th 2015)

Note: If you request an automatic renewal on the 29th, 30th or 31st, it will automatically take place on the 1st of the following month, depending on the number of days in the month (February, for example).
