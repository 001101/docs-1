## 
With the OVH Public Cloud you can now change the contacts for billing and project administration. 
This means that you can seperate the OVH account which manages your bills from the OVH account which manages your various instances. 

This guide explains how to edit your contacts.


## Requirements

- two OVH accounts
- a Public Cloud project
- be sure that both admin and billing contacts belongs to the same subsidiary

## Instructions

In order to modify your project contacts, first go to the Contacts and Rights bellow Project management tab.

Once you have confirmed the new contacts, both OVH accounts will receive an email containing a code allowing them to confirm this change:

You have to confirm this procedure in both accounts.

In both contacts Control Panel, you have to go to the My requests section:

You just have to insert the code which you have just received by email into the window which appeared after you confirmed the procedure from both accounts.

After this is done, contacts have been changed as requested.
