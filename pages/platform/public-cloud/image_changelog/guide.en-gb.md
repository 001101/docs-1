## Objective

OVHcloud offers a variety of operating systems and pre-installed applications on the VPS and Public cloud products. As a provider, we ensure the images we provide to our customers are kept up to date which means we reguaraly release new images. Transparency is key to OVHcloud and we intend to share what changes we make to any image during any new release. This page will allow customers to track the changelog of our images.

## Requirements

This documentation will only apply to [VPS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/vps/compare/) and [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/compute/) only.
