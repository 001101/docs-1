**Last updated 25th February, 2019.**

We list here some details on the APIs we expose, the software versions we use and the resources we reserve on each node.


## OVH APIs 

We have added a [Kubernetes section](https://api.ovh.com/console/#/kube) to the [OVH API](https://api.ovh.com/). Using it you will be able to add and remove nodes, update and reset your clusters or getting `kubectl` configuration.

> [!primary]
> If you have never used the OVH API, you can see the basis on [First steps with the OVH API](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/first-steps-with-ovh-api/).


## Kubernetes versions

Currently we support both Kubernetes 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.

By default, new clusters are generated on Kubernetes 1.13, but you can switch to Kubernetes 1.11 or 1.12 using the [OVH Cloud Manager](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/).

We will closely follow the Kubernetes releases, and new versions will be regularly available.


## OS and Docker versions

The OS and Docker demon version on your nodes will be regularly updated. Current versions are:

- OS: CoreOS 1967.6.0
- Docker: 18.06.1-ce

## Reserved resources

Each worker node has 1 GB of RAM and 100 mCPU reserved for Kubernetes components. 

This reserved quotas may evolve in the future, the page will be updated when it does
